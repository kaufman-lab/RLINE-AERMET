## 1. Overview

This project details the pipeline for implementing AERMET and RLINE in Linux environment. We use AERMET to prepare meteorological '.sfc' file, which serves as an input for RLINE. 

The repo provides RLINE and AERMET source code (written in fortran) and their corresponding compilation scripts. In addition, the instructions for obtaining required data and helper functions are included. We use data analysis examples to illustrate the pipeline. 

## 2. Singularity Container

We guarantee reproduciblility of the entire process by encapsulating it in a singularity environment container. Thus, the version of AERMET and RLINE we adopt in the pipeline might not be the most recent ones. This document relies on AERMET version v21112, which published in April 2021, and its the most recent version as the document is created (December 2021). One could download the same executable from EPA website (https://gaftp.epa.gov/Air/aqmg/SCRAM/models/met/aermet/aermet_source.zip), before a newer version releases. The RLINE version considered is v1.2 and it is available from https://www.cmascenter.org/r-line/.  

The singularity image can be found in package of this Github repo. We already complied RLINE and AERMET such that upon entering the image, user will be ready to implement either or both programs given the required data input.




## 3. Implementation of AERMET from image


We acknowledge that part of the following scripts are adapted from the instruction found at https://linux.vbird.org/enve/aermet-op.php. We will prepare meteorological data for Los Angeles as an example. 


### 3.1 Prepare Executables 

The executables for AERMET and RLINE are already compiled within the singularity image. Since the folders and files within the image cannot be modified, we need to copy compiled executable to file system in the local host.

First create a local directory on the host, then download the most recent version of the image from Github repo (suffix might need to be changed to match the most recent one) and enter the singularity image. 

```
[yunhanwu@deohs-brain ~]$ mkdir aermet_testrun
[yunhanwu@deohs-brain ~]$ cd aermet_testrun

[yunhanwu@deohs-brain aermet_testrun]$ singularity shell --containall oras://ghcr.io/kaufman-lab/aermet_rline_func:dev
```

To access the files from the image, we need to use '/' before specifying the directory. For example, the following command could be used to check files within the singularity image.  The executables for AERMET and RLINE are stored in their corresponding folders. 

```
Singularity> ls /

Singularity> ls /aermet_demo

Singularity> ls /RLINE

```


Now we copy the directory named 'build' under 'aermet_demo', which contains the source code and executables.

```
Singularity> cp /aermet_demo/build -r build

```

Lastly, we link the executable 'aermet.exe'.

```
Singularity> ln -s build/aermet.exe 

```


### 3.2 Obtaining Source Data

AERMET requires at least two data input. The first is surface meteorological data from ground stations, which is available from Integrated Surface Database (ISD) website (ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/noaa/). The second is upper air data, which is available from NOAA/ESRL Radiosonde Database (https://ruc.noaa.gov/raobs/). 

Our Github repo facilitates the data downloading process through the following venues:

1. **Upper Air Data**: The release called "Upper Air Data" hosts data downloaded from NOAA/ESRL Radiosonde Database. Data from 1991-2010 are available and they are identified by the unique WBAN identifier for the stations.

2. **Master List for Stations**: In the folder 'station_list', there are two separate lists detailing the information about ground stations and upper air stations. Relevant information includes coordinates (longitude, latitude and altitude), WBAN identifier, start and end dates.

3. **Helper Functions**: We provide two helper functions for downloading the surface and upper air data. The xy_to_id.R function generates a list of stations ordered by the distance to the coordinates provided. The get_surf_up.R function downloads data for specified WABN identifier and year.

Now we turn to the LA example. First we call xy_to_id.R to examine the candidate lists for stations. The arguments of the function are year (for the surface and upper air data), longitude and latitudes for the location of interest (negative for W). The default of the function is to return three closest stations for ground and upper air stations respectively, and the user could get a longer list by specifying the length in the end as an additional argument.  

```
Singularity> Rscript --vanilla /xy_to_id.R 2010 -118.2437 34.0522

```

The output looks like the following. Now the function only support station search for a single year, if the user is interested in multiple years, we suggest the user to run the function for each year and find the station with most available data. The preferable choice is usually the first row. However, as we proceed to the first stage of AERMET, we might find the quality of the data not acceptable. In that case, we might switch stations by going down through the list.

The output is prepared based on the master lists hosted under the folder 'station_list'. Information about the station including WABN identifier, longitude, latitude and altitude will also be needed for AERMET procedures.

47     EDWARDS AFB UPPER AIR CA    CA   98940.95
621 SAN NICOLAS ISLAND SITE1 CA    CA  143070.73

```

In this case, we pick the closest ones. We use the WABN identifiers as arguments for the function get_surf_up.R. The order is year, WBAN for ground station and WABN for upper air station.

```
Singularity> cp /get_surf_up.R get_surf_up.R

Singularity> Rscript --vanilla get_surf_up.R 2010 93134 93111

```


AERMET requires all file names to be capitalized, so we rename them.


```
Singularity> cp air_dat/SURF_DAT SURF_DAT

Singularity> cp air_dat/UP_AIR UP_AIR

```

### 3.3 Run AERMET in Linux

#### 3.3.1 Stage 1


We first get the sample control files for our LA example. 

```
Singularity> wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/kaufman-lab/AERMET/blob/main/AERMET_example/S1.INP?raw\=true

Singularity> mv S1.INP?raw\=true S1.INP

```


There is not much parameters to set in stage 1.
 
1. **XDATES**: The period of time for AERMET to process 
2. **LOCATION**: Longitude, latitude and altitude for the station, also requires WBAN identifier. The second last item is the factor to
convert the time of each data record to local standard time. Since LA is in GMT-8, we use 8 as the time difference.
3. **AUDIT**: Adds variables to the list of default variables to be tracked during QA. Here we use a default list.

Now we execute stage 1 and the data quality information could be found under the .RPT file.

```

Singularity> ./aermet.exe S1.INP
Singularity> view LA_TEST_S1.RPT

```

####  3.3.2 Stage 2


Similarly, we download the control file for stage 2.

```
Singularity> wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/kaufman-lab/AERMET/blob/main/AERMET_example/S2.INP?raw\=true

Singularity> mv S2.INP?raw\=true S2.INP

Singularity> view LA_TEST_S2.RPT

```


#### 3.3.3 Stage 3

Stage 3 is the actual processing stage and it requires some parameters and builds upon the output from stage 2. Here we primarily used the default settings. The choice of surface parameters is defined under \'SITE_CHAR\'. Here we used the albedo, midday Bowen ratio and surface roughness length from example 1 in the AERMET documentation. We note that this is inaccurate and further investigation is needed to better determine these parameters, perhaps using AERSURFACE. In addition the usage of \'SECTOR'\ is not explored in this implementation.

```


```

Singularity> view LA_TEST_S3.RPT

```


## 4. Implementation of RLINE in Linux


Similarly, we create a local directory on the host. 

```
Singularity> mkdir rline_testrun
Singularity> cd rline_testrun

```

Then we move the RLINE source file. Note that in this example, we predict the emission coming from A1 road in LA during 2010. But data for the example 1 in RLINE official documentation is also contained in this directory. One might try it out directly (without moving or modifying any file). 

```
Singularity> cp /RLINE/RLINE_source/ -r RLINE_source
Singularity> cd RLINE_source

```

And we move AERMET processed meteorological data to the directory. 
```
Singularity> cp ../../aermet_testrun/LA_TEST_MP.SFC Met_Example.sfc
```

Or alternatively, we could download the .sfc file from github repo, which is same as the output from our earlier AERMET example.  

```

Singularity> wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/kaufman-lab/
AERMET/blob/main/RLINE_example/Met_Example.sfc?raw\=true

Singularity> mv Met_Example.sfc?raw\=true Met_Example.sfc

```


Then we get example prediction locations and source data from github repo.

```

Singularity> wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/kaufman-lab/
AERMET/blob/main/RLINE_example/Source_Example.txt?raw\=true

Singularity> mv Source_Example.txt?raw\=true Source_Example.txt


```

```

Singularity> wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/kaufman-lab/
AERMET/blob/main/RLINE_example/Receptor_Example.txt?raw\=true

Singularity> mv Receptor_Example.txt?raw\=true Receptor_Example.txt


```


We also get the procedure file. This almost remains unchanged from the fist official example from RLINE. We only change the option for using analytical solution (the default is to use numerical). According to the documentation of RLINE, numerical solution is a bit more accurate but much more computationally expensive. Give the amount of data in our example, we opt for analytical solution.

```

Singularity> wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/kaufman-lab/
AERMET/blob/main/RLINE_example/Line_Source_Inputs.txt?raw\=true

Singularity> mv Line_Source_Inputs.txt?raw\=true Line_Source_Inputs.txt


```


To obtain the results, we simply run the executable. The results will then be stored in the same directory as .csv files.

```

Singularity>  ./rline_out.out


```
